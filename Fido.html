        <h1>Instructions for Fido's babysitter</h1>
        
        <p>Thanks so much for watching Fido this weekened!  Here's everything you need to know while I'm gone.</p>
        
        <p> Here's a bit of history about Fido:
         He is a 50 ft tall baby animal that looks like a combination of a dog, a bird, and a cat.  You will need to take care of Fido by climbing on top of him in order to pet his head, feeding him barrels, and removing the occasional spears from him.</p>
        
        <p class="important">
        The color of Fido's eyes change depending on his mood. His eyes shine pink when aggressive or angry. The eyes will glow white when excited or interested. When his eyes are dark green, he is calm and friendly. His pupils will contract greatly when he is satisfied when being fed a barrel.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Fido can generate and fire electricity. He can fire a continuous bolt of electricity from his tail if you're shining a mirror on something. Fido can also fire a built-up pulse of explosive lightning at random.  Be careful.
        </p>
        
        <p>Here are a list of things that you should do with Fido every day:</p>
        
        <ul class="important">
            <li>Feed him at least 8 barrels a day of food.</li>
            <li>Watch out for his lightening blasts.</li>
            <li>Be sure to let him get out to stretch his wings on a flight around the neighborhood at least once a day.</li>
            <li>Don't let him eat any neighbors.</li>
        </ul>
